IguanaTweaks for Tinkers Construct
==================================

The not really official repo for Iguana Tweaks for [Tinker's Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct).
Current Minecraft Version: 1.7.10

Everything is highly work in Progress.

##Special thanks go to:
* Glassmaker for starting the port and being awesome in general
* mDiyo, progwml6, Sunstrike and everybody else who worked on Tinkers and Mantle
* Squeek502 for [TiC Tooltips](https://github.com/squeek502/TiC-Tooltips) which allowed me to do Tooltips properly
* iguana_man for creating the original Iguana Tweaks for Tinkers Construct
* MoxieGrrl for lots of testing and being a darling.
